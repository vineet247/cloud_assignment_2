## Cloud based video doorbell.
In this assignment, we use AWS services to build a cloud based video doorbell service which will allow users to gain access to their homes using facial recognition. It will also allow home users to create a list of 'known' faces; these faces can be those of friends or family. When these 'known' persons arrive, the app sends the user a notification that the 'known' person has arrived. It also gives the 'known' person an OTP for verification. If an 'unknown' person is detected, the app asks the guest to sign up. Once signed up, the app sends the home owner an image of the guest for verification. If verified, the app sends the 'unknown' guest an OTP and adds the 'unknown' user to the 'known' list.
